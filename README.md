## ðŸ›  **Installation**

To get started, follow these simple steps:

### 1. **Download the Script**

First, download the script to your computer. You can do this by either:

- **Direct download**: Click on the `Download` button from the repository (or source).
- **Using `wget`**: If you prefer using the terminal:

    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KostasSliazas/timesaver/main/install-kubuntu-extras.sh
    ```

### 2. **Set Permissions**

Before running the script, make sure itâ€™s executable. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
sudo chmod +x install-kubuntu-extras.sh
```
This command makes the script executable on your system. You may be prompted for your password to grant the necessary permissions.
### 3. Run the Script

Now, youâ€™re ready to run the script! In your terminal, execute the following command:
```bash
sudo ./install-kubuntu-extras.sh
```
And there you go! You might need to enter your password again for the script to execute with elevated permissions.
